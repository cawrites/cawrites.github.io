In the data modeling process define what you data you will capture from the user and how it you will build records based on 
existing or crowd sourced data.

For capturing Allergy related data the recommendation is to use BOOLEAN field type, for example

```sql
CREATE TABLE user-profile (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user info (multiple rows of data collection)
    allergy type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
    completed BOOLEAN
```

# Questions to consider
   
 * What are you tracking?
 * What other tables are needed?
 * How will the data be used?
 * Is there a reporting requirement?
 * Will you source any other repositories of data



* Non- HIPAA data collection
* Disclaimer describing how the data is used
